Takes a file from yahoo stock history and uses data from it to calculate 20 day exponential moving average, 20 day simple moving average and the 20 day standard deviation. Prints the new data to the original file. This works for any two dates, my sample test is across ten years. Program is set up to have multiple files converted in the future by adding a simple loop.
